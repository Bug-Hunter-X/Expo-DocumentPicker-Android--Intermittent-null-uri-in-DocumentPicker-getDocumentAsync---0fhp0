This bug occurs when using the Expo DocumentPicker API on Android.  The issue is that after selecting a file, the promise returned by DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync() sometimes resolves with a null uri property even when a file has been successfully selected. This leads to errors further down the line when attempting to access the file's path or content.  The problem is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently, but it causes unpredictable app crashes.  It seems to be linked to specific file types or Android versions, although no definitive pattern has been established yet.
